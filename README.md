## Overview
Over the past 50 years, the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics has become the most important and transparent source of external debt data of low- and middle-income countries. This repository contains data and analyses related to international debt statistics from 2006 to 2022.

## Why It Matters
Understanding international debt statistics is crucial for several reasons:

- **Debt Transparency**: Poor debt transparency in the past led many countries to sleepwalk into debt crises. Knowing what a country owes and to whom is essential for better debt management and sustainability.
  
- **Guiding Debt Restructuring**: Clear data can guide debt restructuring efforts to help a country get back on track toward economic stability and growth when problems arise.
  
- **Addressing Worrying Debt Levels**: Debt levels in developing economies are at worrying levels, making it more important than ever to understand and manage international debt.
